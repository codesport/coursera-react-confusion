## How-to Guide

### 2. Create a Remote Repo on GitHub via the Command Line

    curl -H "Authorization: token PLACE_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"coursera-react", "private":"true", "description":"React 101 Course", "homepage":"https://codesport.io"}'


### 3. Connect Local Repo to the Remote 

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:GITHUB_USER_NAME/PROJECT_NAME.git

git push -u upstream master #NB: for first commit -u is shorthand for '--set-upstream' and activates branch tracking
```

> NB: We are calling our remote, slave repo `upstream`. `Upstream` is named when the local repo is the master, source repo. Alternatively, we would name the 
> remote repo `origin` when the remote is the master, source repo. For example, when we fork someone else's project with the intent of doing a pull request, 
> the remote repo would be the origin, source and master repor

### 4. [Optional: Install ReactStrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap)

```
npm add bootstrap
npm add reactstrap react react-dom
```

Import Bootstrap CSS into the src/index.js file likeso: 

`import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'`
